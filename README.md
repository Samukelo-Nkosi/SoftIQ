### GUI Framework

- **Java Swing**
- `JFrame`
- `JPanel`
- `JButton`
- `JLabel`
- `JRadioButton`
- `ButtonGroup`
- `CardLayout`

---

## Requirements

To run SoftIQ, you need:

- **JDK 8 or later**
- A Java-compatible IDE or terminal
- Windows, macOS, or Linux

The project is compatible with modern Java versions such as **JDK 21**.

Verify your Java installation:

```bash
java -version
javac -version
```

---

## Running the Application

### Option 1: Command Line

Open a terminal in the `SoftwareIQ` project directory.

Compile the source files:

```bash
cd src
javac softwareiq/*.java -d ../out
```

Run the application:

```bash
cd ../out
java softwareiq.SoftwareIQ
```

---

### Option 2: Visual Studio Code

1. Install the **Extension Pack for Java** from Microsoft.
2. Open the `SoftwareIQ` folder in VS Code.
3. Open:

```text
src/softwareiq/SoftIQ.java
```

4. Click **Run** above the `main()` method.

Alternatively, press:

```text
F5
```

The included `.vscode/launch.json` configuration is already configured to launch:

```text
softwareiq.SoftwareIQ
```

---

### Option 3: IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Select **Open**.
3. Choose the `SoftwareIQ` project folder.
4. Configure a JDK if IntelliJ asks you to.
5. Mark `src` as a **Sources Root** if it is not detected automatically.
6. Open:

```text
src/softwareiq/SoftIQ.java
```

7. Run the `main()` method.

---

## How the Quiz Works

1. Launch SoftIQ.
2. Select **Start Quiz**.
3. Choose a topic.
4. Read the question.
5. Select one of the available answers.
6. Click **Submit Answer**.
7. SoftIQ immediately indicates whether the answer is correct.
8. If the answer is incorrect, the correct answer is displayed.
9. Continue through the remaining questions.
10. After the final question, select **Finish Quiz**.
11. View your score, percentage, and grade.
12. Retake the topic or choose another topic.

---

## Adding Questions

Questions are managed centrally inside:

```text
src/softwareiq/QuestionBank.java
```

A question follows this structure:

```java
q.add(new Question(
    "Your question here?",
    new String[]{
        "Option A",
        "Option B",
        "Option C",
        "Option D"
    };
    1
));
```

The final number represents the index of the correct answer.

Java arrays use **zero-based indexing**, so:

```text
0 = Option A
1 = Option B
2 = Option C
3 = Option D
```

For example:

```java
q.add(new Question(
    "Which language is used to build SoftIQ?",
    new String[]{"Python", "Java", "C++", "PHP"},
    1
));
```

In this example, `1` means **Java** is the correct answer.

---

## Adding a New Topic

New topics can also be added through `QuestionBank.java`.

First, register the topic:

```java
BANK.put("Operating Systems", buildOperatingSystemQuestions());
```

Then create its question list:

```java
private static List<Question> buildOperatingSystemQuestions() {
    List<Question> q = new ArrayList<>();

    q.add(new Question(
        "What does CPU stand for?",
        new String[]{
            "Central Processing Unit",
            "Computer Processing Utility",
            "Central Program Unit",
            "Control Processing Unit"
        },
        0
    ));

    return q;
}
```

The new topic will automatically appear on the topic-selection screen because the UI reads topics directly from `QuestionBank`.

---

## Architecture

SoftIQ follows a simple component-based structure.

```text
                    SoftIQ.java
                         │
                         ▼
                    MainFrame
                         │
             ┌───────────┼───────────┐
             ▼           ▼           ▼
       WelcomePanel  TopicPanel  QuizPanel
                                     │
                                     ▼
                               QuestionBank
                                     │
                                     ▼
                                  Question
                                     │
                                     ▼
                               ResultPanel
```

`MainFrame` controls navigation between the application's panels using Java Swing's `CardLayout`.

---

## Design Decisions

### CardLayout Navigation

`MainFrame` uses `CardLayout` to switch between:

- Welcome
- Topic selection
- Quiz
- Results

This keeps the application inside a single main window while allowing different screens to behave independently.

### Centralized Question Bank

All quiz content is stored in `QuestionBank.java`. This makes it easier to:

- Add questions
- Add new topics
- Modify existing questions
- Maintain quiz content without changing the UI

### Question Data Model

The `Question` class keeps the question text, answer options, and correct answer index together.

This separates quiz data from the interface and makes the application easier to maintain.

## Future Improvements

Possible future versions of SoftIQ could include:

- [ ] Larger question bank
- [ ] Randomized questions
- [ ] Randomized answer options
- [ ] Difficulty levels
- [ ] Timed quizzes
- [ ] High-score leaderboard
- [ ] User profiles
- [ ] Persistent scores
- [ ] SQLite/MySQL database integration
- [ ] Quiz history
- [ ] Custom quiz creation
- [ ] Dark/light theme switching
- [ ] Sound effects
- [ ] Progress statistics
- [ ] Exportable results
- [ ] Online question database
- [ ] Unit and integration tests

---

## Known Limitations

The current version is intentionally lightweight:

- Questions are stored directly in Java source code.
- Scores are not persisted after the application closes.
- There is no user authentication.
- There is no external database.
- The question order is fixed.
- Each topic contains a relatively small number of questions.

These limitations provide opportunities for future development.

---

## Contributing

Contributions and improvements are welcome.

A typical workflow is:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd SoftIQ
```

Create a feature branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/new-topic
```

Make your changes, test the application, then commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add new quiz topic"
```

Push the branch:

```bash
git push origin feature/new-topic
```
